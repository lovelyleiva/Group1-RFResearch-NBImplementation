Each part to the two part project has it's own folder.

** RANDOM FOREST RESEARCH FOLDER **
* Random Forest Slideshow
    This PDF is Group #1's slideshow for our research into Random Forest. All research we used can be found in the Random Forest Appendix. 
    To the team that will be implementing Random Forest, you can go back to the zoom recording from 9/9/22 to view our presentation.
* Random Forest Appendix
    This PDF contains all research we used for our research product. There are links to blogs, scikit documentation, images, flowcharts, and youtube videos. Weâ€™ve highlighted some information that we found useful. We encourage you to dig through these resources and further continue your exploration!
* sample-random-forest-code.ipynb
    We've created a sample code using Random Forest. We've used the diabetes.csv that we've worked with in class and are all familiar with. 
* diabetes.csv
    Diabetes.csv is the same csv we are given in the lessons. We've used this for an example dataset to work on and demonstrate Random Forest. 

** NAIVE BAYES IMPLEMENTATION FOLDER **
* Naive Bayes Slideshow
    This PDF is Group #1's slideshow for our implementation and results using Naive Bayes. You can view the zoom recording from 9/12/22 to view our presentation.
* NB_LR_Comparison_Final.ipynb
    This Jupyter Notebook holds the code for our Naive Bayes model and the comparison with Logistic Regression. To run this code, you must have the Diabetes.csv in the same directory.
